Create a class for baseball players. Define the attributes/data and functions (constructor, setters, getters and functions specific to a baseball player.



Consider that initially, the batting average of a new baseball player object is 0. If the player then gets to bat and hits the ball, the batting average will be (0 + 1)/2 = 0.500. So one member function can be a batting_average function. Think about and try to implement this in the class and what you will need to do in the main program to simulate a hit or miss and update the players batting average. You can include any other functions you think are appropriate. If you donâ€™t know much about baseball (like me), talk to someone who knows the game.
